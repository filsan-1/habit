Progress Percentages: Along with streaks, the app displays your progress toward habit goals as percentages. This allows users to see how close they are to achieving their targets, providing an extra push to stay on track.

D3.js Features
By using D3.js, the app offers rich, interactive data visualizations. These streaks are customizable and dynamically updated, allowing users to interact with their progress data in **real-time.**
The visualizations turn habit tracking into an enjoyable experience, not just an informative one.
